# Grunwald
Grunwald approximation of spectrally positive jump L\'evy processes in an interval using the generalised Gr\"unwald approximation developped in [this work by B Baeumer, M. Kov\'acs and L. Toniazzi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10864). Allowed boundary conditions are Dirichlet (killing), Neumann (Stochastic reflection) and fast-forwarding.
